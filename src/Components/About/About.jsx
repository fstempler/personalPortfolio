                        My name is Federico M. Stempler and I enjoy creating front-end applications, coding and learning new stuff constantly. I became interested in web development in 2005 at the age of 17 trying to edit custom Blogger themes, that thought me a lot about HTML and CSS. 
                        For many years my love for web developing and coding was only a hobby as I developed my career as an account manager and sales rep. for game companies such as Domo Sur and Devir. Then I became interested in marketing and I started a carrer as a freelance marketing consultant for different companies and worked with different marketing agencies as Wow Marketing & Comunicaci√≥n, Luz Digital and One Love. 
                        Today I perfected my skills in front-end developing in CoderHouse, where I learned HTML, CSS, JS, React and every tool needed to build accesible, inclusive products and digital experiences for a variety of clients. 
                        I'm open to job opportunities where I can contribute, learn and grow.
